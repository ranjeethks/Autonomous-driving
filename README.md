9 layer convolution neural network to clone autonomous driving behavior 

In this project a car is made to navigate autonomously in a simulated environment.

Drving behavior is cloned on to the car using a 9 layer deep neural network (CNN).

Please see output videos here: [Car navigating in an easy terrain](https://youtu.be/1Kj7_sPdU3A) and [car navigating is a tough terrain](https://youtu.be/qSiufyAGMg8)

A detailed report on how the car was trained and what architecture was implemented is provided in [writeup report](https://github.com/ranjeethks/Autonomous-driving/blob/master/Writeup_report.pdf)
