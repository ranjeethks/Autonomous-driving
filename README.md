# Autonomous-driving


In this project a car is made to navigate autonomously in a simulated environment.
9 layer convolution neural network is implemented to clone autonomous driving behavior 

Please see output videos here: [Car navigating in an easy terrain](https://youtu.be/1Kj7_sPdU3A) and [car navigating in a tough terrain](https://youtu.be/qSiufyAGMg8)

A detailed report on how the car was trained and what architecture was implemented is provided in [writeup report](https://github.com/ranjeethks/Autonomous-driving/blob/master/Writeup_report.pdf)
